<p>CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf">CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&quot;

covid_data &lt;- vroom::vroom(url) %&gt;% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn&#39;t work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()</code></pre>
<p>Using the data gathered, I created graphs that shows the % death rate by ge group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not</p>

<p>Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understandâ€“ imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!</p>
